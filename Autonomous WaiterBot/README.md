## AUTONOMOUS WAITERBOT

# ABSRTRACT
The aim of this project is to desing a simulation for a TurtleBot to taking orders via speech recognition, serve customers and / or accept payments at restaurants and catering venues. The TurtleBot used in this project is a line follower and is able to travel to the target tables while avoiding obstacles such as other tables, chairs and even humans, it uses either laser scan or SONAR to detect the obstacles. The customer is be able to call the waiterBot for placing order by using a python based application interface / kiosk, that is on the table. After summoning the robot, the customer will place order verbally. Due to physical limitations on the payload capacity of the TurtleBot, the "WaiterBot" will only be able to serve specific items such as drinks or food items weighing less than 8 pounds.
